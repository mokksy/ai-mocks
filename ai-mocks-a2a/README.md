# AI Mocks A2A

A mock server for testing Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol integrations.

## Overview

This library provides a mock server that simulates an A2A protocol endpoint for testing purposes. It allows developers to test their A2A client implementations without connecting to a real A2A server.
